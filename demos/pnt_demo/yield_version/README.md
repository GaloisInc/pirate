# PNT Demo Project Pirate initial version

This is an adaption of the NGC 6 month demo code to partition the
demo into two executables.  It uses the `pirate_yield` functionality
for ensuring a single thread remains active.

It is not actively maintained, and we recommend external users
first try out `getopt_version`.
