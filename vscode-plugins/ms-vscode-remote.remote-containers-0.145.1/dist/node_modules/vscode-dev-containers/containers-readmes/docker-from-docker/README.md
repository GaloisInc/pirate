## Description

Dev containers can be useful for all types of applications including those that also deploy into a container based-environment. While you can directly build and run the application inside the dev container you create, you may also want to test it by deploying a built container image into your local Docker Desktop instance without affecting your dev container.

This example illustrates how you can do this by running CLI commands and using the [Docker VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) right from inside your dev container. It installs the Docker extension inside the container so you can use its full feature set with your project.

## How it works / adapting your existing dev container config

The [`.devcontainer` folder in this repository](.devcontainer) contains a complete example that **you can simply change the `FROM` statement** to another Debian/Ubuntu based image to adapt to your own use (along with adding anything else you need).

However, this section will outline the how you can selectively add this functionality to your own Dockerfile in two parts: enabling access to Docker for the root user, and enabling it for a non-root user.

### Enabling root user access to Docker in the container

You can adapt your own existing development container Dockerfile to support this scenario when running as **root** by following these steps:

1. First, install the Docker CLI in your container. From `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`:

    ```Dockerfile
    # Install Docker CE CLI
    RUN apt-get update \
        && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg2 lsb-release \
        && curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/$(lsb_release -is | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')/gpg | apt-key add - 2>/dev/null \
        && echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(lsb_release -is | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list \
        && apt-get update \
        && apt-get install -y docker-ce-cli

    # Install Docker Compose
    RUN LATEST_COMPOSE_VERSION=$(curl -sSL "https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest" | grep -o -P '(?<="tag_name": ").+(?=")') \
        && curl -sSL "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${LATEST_COMPOSE_VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose \
        && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

2. Then just forward the Docker socket by mounting it in the container using the `mounts` property. From `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

    ```json
    "runArgs": ["--init"],
    "mounts": [ "source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock,type=bind" ]
    ```

    While technically optional, `--init` enables an [init process](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#specify-an-init-process) to properly handle signals and ensure [Zombie Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process) are cleaned up.

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** so the changes take effect.

### Enabling non-root access to Docker in the container

To enable non-root access to Docker in the container, you use `socat` to proxy the Docker socket without affecting its permissions. This is safer than updating the permissions of the host socket itself since this would apply to all containers. You can also alias `docker` to be `sudo docker` in a `.bashrc` file, but this does not work in cases where the Docker socket is accessed directly.

Follow these directions to set up non-root access using `socat`:

1. Follow [the instructions in the Remote - Containers documentation](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/non-root) to create a non-root user with sudo access if you do not already have one.

2. Follow the [directions in the previous section](#enabling-root-user-access-to-docker-in-the-container) to install the Docker CLI.

3. Update your `devcontainer.json` to mount the Docker socket to `docker-host.sock` in the container and enable the non-root user:

    ```json
    "runArgs": ["--init"],
    "mounts": [ "source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker-host.sock,type=bind" ],
    "overrideCommand": false,
    "remoteUser": "vscode"
    ```

4. Next, add the following to your `Dockerfile` to wire up `socat`:

    ```Dockerfile
    ARG NONROOT_USER=vscode

    # Default to root only access to the Docker socket, set up non-root init script
    RUN touch /var/run/docker-host.sock \
        && ln -s /var/run/docker-host.sock /var/run/docker.sock \
        && apt-get update \
        && apt-get -y install socat

    # Create docker-init.sh to spin up socat
    RUN echo "#!/bin/sh\n\
        sudo rm -rf /var/run/docker.sock\n\
        ((sudo socat UNIX-LISTEN:/var/run/docker.sock,fork,mode=660,user=${NONROOT_USER} UNIX-CONNECT:/var/run/docker-host.sock) 2>&1 >> /tmp/vscr-dind-socat.log) & > /dev/null\n\
        \"\$@\"" >> /usr/local/share/docker-init.sh \
        && chmod +x /usr/local/share/docker-init.sh

    # VS Code by default overrides ENTRYPOINT and CMD with default values when executing `docker run`.
    # Setting the ENTRYPOINT to docker-init.sh will configure non-root access to
    # the Docker socket if "overrideCommand": false is set in devcontainer.json.
    # The script will also execute CMD if you need to alter startup behaviors.
    ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/local/share/docker-init.sh" ]
    CMD [ "sleep", "infinity" ]
    ```

5. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** so the changes take effect.

That's it!

## Using bind mounts when working with Docker inside the container

A common question that comes up is how you can use `bind` mounts from the Docker CLI from within the Codespace itself (e.g. via `-v`). The trick is that, since you're acutally using Docker sitting outside of the container, the paths will be different than those in the container. You need to use the **host**'s paths instead. A simple way to do this is to put `${localWorkspaceFolder}` in an environment variable that you then use when doing bind mounts inside the container. 

Add the following to `devcontainer.json`:

```
"remoteEnv": { "LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER": "${localWorkspaceFolder}" }
```

Then reference the env var when running Docker commands from the terminal inside the container.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v ${LOCAL_WORKSPACE_FOLDER}:/workspace debian bash
```

## Using this definition with an existing folder

There are no special setup steps are required, but note that the included `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` can be altered to work with other Debian/Ubuntu-based container images such as `node` or `python`. Just, update the `FROM` statement to reference the new base image. For example:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:lts
```

Beyond that, just follow these steps to use the definition:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) to set up your machine.

2. To use VS Code's copy of this definition:
   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...** from the command palette.
   3. Select the Docker from Docker definition.

3. To use latest-and-greatest copy of this definition from the repository:
   1. Clone this repository.
   2. Copy the contents of `containers/docker-from-docker/.devcontainer` to the root of your project folder.
   3. Start VS Code and open your project folder.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** to start using the definition.
